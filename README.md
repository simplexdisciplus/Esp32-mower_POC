# Esp32-mower_POC
If I could build a robot mower with plenty of functionality I will save lot of time (perhaps I will spent this time to build this robot) :-) let's go to learn  lot of stuff about arduino ESP32, come on
What features I want?

1) mow the grass

2) make the blade rotate while the robot is near the ground but stop it if not

3) go forward until it find a wall (by ultrasonic sensors or by switchs)

4) check the free distance at left and at right

5) turn to the longer distance

6) do this while an hour

extra features

7) pilot the robot with the phone

8) start everydays at the same time or not

9) check the power used by blade to have a lower rotation when the grass is already cut

10) make it easy for no geek people :-)
